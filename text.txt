SSH using SSH cert
//raspberry pi
1 create the CA for the ssh SSH dont use the x.509 certificate  but use the SSH certificate

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f CA

2 now I have the CA I need to add it to the Client/target i want to use remote acces with certificate to acces

3 inside the raspberry i will need to changes
3.1 add the CA.pub certificate
    sudo cp CA.pub /etc/ssh/CA.pub
3.2 change permisson to make sure root is owned by root (user, group)
    sudo chown root:root /etc/ssh/ca_user.pub
    sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssh/ca_user.pub

4 eddit the SSH configuration 
    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    inside change
    TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/CA.pub
    make so only certificate work
    PasswordAuthentication no
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    PermitRootLogin no
5 restart ssh
    sudo systemctl restart ssh

6 now with the CA we should be create certs to login and use the raspberry pi
    the point is to generate with experation date NOTE CA JOB TO SET THE experation date

7 now it should work 

8 future set it up to expose to internet
